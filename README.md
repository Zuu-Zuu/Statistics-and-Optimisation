# Multiple Linear Regression & Time Series Analysis

## Overview
This project applies statistical and machine learning techniques to analyze two major datasets:

1. **Multiple Linear Regression Analysis** - Identifying key predictors and evaluating regression assumptions.
2. **Time Series Analysis** - Forecasting trends using ARIMA and SARIMA models.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, normalization, and feature selection.
- **Statistical Assumptions Testing**: Homoscedasticity, Normality, Autocorrelation, and Multicollinearity checks.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) Regression, ARIMA, SARIMA.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: R-squared, MAE, RMSE, ADF Test for stationarity.

## Installation
Ensure you have Python installed and install dependencies using:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn statsmodels matplotlib seaborn
```

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Zuu-Zuu/Statistics-and-Optimisation.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Statistics-and-Optimisation
   ```
3. Run Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
4. Open the respective notebooks for each analysis.
